## Tic Tac Toe AI with Neural Network. The Resurrections.

[![Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Neural-Network-Resurrections](https://github.com/cmirnow/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Neural-Network-Resurrections/blob/master/images/ai.gif)](https://masterpro.ws/neural-network-tictactoe)

In the new version of the game ([the first version](https://cmirnow.github.io/glidejs-vanta-react)) you can play with Neural Network first or second (this choice is random). But don't forget, this is just a concept. AI is now in an active development phase. :)

How to start playing:

```bash
gem install csv ruby-fann progress_bar tty-pie
git clone https://github.com/cmirnow/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Neural-Network-Resurrections.git
cd https://github.com/cmirnow/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Neural-Network-Resurrections
ruby start.rb
```

This script does not know the strategies of Tic Tac Toe. After the first launch, the program creates a csv-file containing records of Tic Tac Toe games played out by chance. Then, the Neural Network helps AI to find the optimal moves. Can you beat the Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Neural-Network? Good luck to you!
