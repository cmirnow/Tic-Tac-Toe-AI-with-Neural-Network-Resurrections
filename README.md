The script doesn't know how to play Tic Tac Toe. The first launch creates a csv-file of Tic Tac Toe games played by chance. Then, the Neural Network helps AI to find the optimal moves. Can you beat this AI? Good luck to you!

:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: | In the new version of the game, you can play against a Neural Network either first or second (this choice is random).

You'll need Ruby.

:exclamation: | Ruby-fann has [problems](https://github.com/tangledpath/ruby-fann/issues/28) with Ruby 3.2 now. Be careful.

How to start playing:

```bash
gem install csv ruby-fann progress_bar tty-pie
git clone https://github.com/cmirnow/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Neural-Network-Resurrections.git
cd Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Neural-Network-Resurrections
ruby start.rb
```
